# Copilot Documentation Skill

Whenever you add or modify content in the `documentacion/` directory, you MUST follow these rules:

1.  **Bilingual Requirement**: Every change or addition MUST be applied to both the Spanish (`documentacion/docs/es/`) and English (`documentacion/docs/en/`) versions of the documentation.
2.  **Consistency**: Ensure that the structure, code snippets, and meanings are consistent across both versions.
3.  **Detailed Explanation**: Always provide a detailed explanation of the changes made, why they were made, and how they affect the documentation set.
4.  **Verification**: Before completing the task, double-check that no file was left out and that both languages are equally updated.
